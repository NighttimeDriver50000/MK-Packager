Description: Portable sound library - development files
 This library is capable of playing samples as well as module files
 and was originally written by Jean-Paul Mikkers (MikMak) for DOS. It
 has subsequently been hacked by many hands and now runs on many Unix
 flavours.
 .
 It supports OSS, ALSA, SDL and PulseAudio outputs, and can also write
 to disk in raw, WAV and AIFF formats.
 .
 Supported file formats include mod, stm, s3m, mtm, xm, and it.
 .
 This package contains the symlinks, headers, and object files needed
 to compile and link programs which use libmikmod.
