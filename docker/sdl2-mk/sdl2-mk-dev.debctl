Description: Simple DirectMedia Layer development files
 SDL is a library that allows programs portable low level access to a video
 framebuffer, audio output, mouse, and keyboard.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to compile and link programs which
 use SDL.
 .
 This package provides and replaces libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-image-dev,
 libsdl2-ttf-dev, and libsdl-sound1.2-dev, with modifications for
 running mkxp. This package is for testing and development only. DO NOT
 install it on a system running production software.
